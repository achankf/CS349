Run with ``make run''

I have tried my best..... spent like 13+ hours per day for several days and skipped several meals... but physics (I failed Gr. 12 physics), geometry, and linear algebra are too difficult for me...

Though, you can still directly manipulate the machine and its arms though the mouse.

Imagine this game as a variant of Tetris, where candy blocks are dropped from the sky, and the doozer have to move the candy blocks so that you can get as many candies as possible... until the bag (screen) is full of candies and then the game is over (you have 10 seconds to move the candies for more room).

I challenge you to play over 100 seconds, and if you are a pro then 200 seconds.
(hint: try to move the candies towards the machine)
P.S. My best record was 250.48 seconds.

Enhancement:
	* Tetris-like gameplay (the time elapsed is the score)
	* scalable window (event during the gameplay)

Hint:
	* the point in front of the magnet indicates where you can pick up a block
	* you can only move each arm for 180 degree
	* candies only fall from the right of the window, so try to move the candies to the left
