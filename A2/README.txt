Run with ``make run''

I have tried my best..... spent like 13+ hours per day for several days and skipped several meals... but physics (I failed Gr. 12 physics), geometry, and linear algebra are too difficult for me...

Though, you can still directly manipulate the machine and its arms though the mouse.

Imagine this game as a variant of Tetris, where candy blocks are dropped from the sky, and the doozer have to move the candy blocks so that you can get as many candies as possible... until the bag (screen) is full of candies and then the game is over (you have 10 seconds to move the candies for more room).

Enhancement:
	* Tetris-like gameplay (the time elapsed is the score)
	* scalable window (event during the gameplay)
